Given the small number of elements, it is much more cost-effective to count them using the Counter class. It may not even be worthwhile to distribute them across multiple partitions, as the process of partitioning and reassembling them could potentially be more time-consuming than simply counting for a small list like this one."

Consequently, 2(c) will increasingly appear as a more efficient approach as the number of elements continues to grow."
